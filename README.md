Here's a quick fix for the Yloader http 429 error until the developer (Adrian) updates the source code.
Give it a try. If it works for you, great! If not, you'll just have to wait for Adrian's modifications.

You can either download the directories and and replace the existing ones or try the appropriate installer.
y6_64_setup.exe or y6_32_setup.exe

x64 is the 64-bit Release build.

x86 is the 32-bit Release build.
